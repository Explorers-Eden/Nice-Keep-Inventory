## Changes:
- Added Spears, Nautilus Armor, Netherite Horse Armor and the new Spawn Eggs to default list of non droppable items
- Items from Graves now fling a bit upwards when spawning
- Added `#keepinv:no_items` tag list which can be used as value in Non-droppable Item tag list config to disable any items being kept on death
- Graves now generate near the last safe position a player has been instead of near the death location (This prevents Graves from generating in the void)
- Changed the sound of Graves when generating or breaking to a more fitting one
- Added some additional Soul particles when generating or breaking a Grave
- Added button to restore default values to config menu
- Added functionality for admins to restore a players inventory from before they last died to config menu:
    - Player needs to be online
    - Items can either be placed in Shulker Boxes or spawned on the ground at the player who executes the functionality
    - Inventory can be restored either filtered by the droppable item tag list (used when the player died) or completly unfiltered including all items
